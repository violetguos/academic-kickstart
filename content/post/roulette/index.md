## Introduction
This project was built in the same course as the multi-cycle CPU! As the reader can see, low level hardware can be fun. The two projects share similar principles, but this project has additional displays, such as a computer screen, a speaker for audio output, and we made the roulette as pretty as we could. They all run on the same hardware chip(field programmable gate array, FPGA).

## Technical Details
- Built a roulette game with PS/2 keyboard, audio output, motor, lego controller, and Altera FPGA
- Implemented linear feedback shift register in Assembly and C to randomize motor speed and spin time
- Interfaced keyboard input to prompt userâ€™s bet and display on VGA output with JTAG UART, JPIO ports

## Lessons Learned
User interface (the screen display, music, and the roulette) makes a difference
Creativity matters: engineers should not only focus on the technical details

Note: this is not my final version. Unfortunately the finished product and a recorded video demo were lost.
