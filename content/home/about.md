# Hello!

I am currently studying Professional MS in Machine Learning (internship option) at University of Montreal, affiliated with MILA lab. I graduated from University of Toronto Electrical and Computer Engineering program in June 2018. I previously interned software positions with electrical and biomedical research context, and have transitioned into computer science with concentration in data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

Coming from ECE background, I am interested in both the statistical inference learning aspect and software/systems/hardware optimization and security of deep learning applications.

N.B. My last name is pronounced “kuo”, not “joe”
